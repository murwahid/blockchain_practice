# PURPOSE

**The purpose of this code repo is familiarizing myself with solidity by practicing writing smart contracts.**


# APPROACH

Similar to how writers are given the advice of "rewrite great literary works word-for-word", the same principle applies.

# AddressBook-Contract 
Exercise: Copy code

Thoughts: 
- The nested if statements and for-looops will lead to a lot of gas consumption. 
- The contract source could have written more efficent code.
